    ## What I Learned Today

    - setTimeout: Delay function execution for animations, notifications, timers, or deferred actions.
    - element.style: Manipulate CSS styles directly from JavaScript (colors, sizes, layout).
    - Working with forms: Listen for submit events and extract data safely.
    - FormData and .get(): Use `new FormData(form)` and `.get()` to read input values cleanly.
    - event.preventDefault(): Stop default form submission to handle data in JavaScript without refresh.
    - CSS row-reverse: Apply `flex-direction: row-reverse;` to reverse item order in a flex container.
    - Toggling classes: Use `element.classList.toggle()` to show/hide UI, switch themes, or trigger animations.
    - disabled attribute: Enable/disable buttons or inputs based on user actions or validation.


Happy Coding!
